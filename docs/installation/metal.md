# Installing DNS4ACME on Bare Metal or a VM

DNS4ACME is a self-contained static binary, so you can run it simply from the command line:

```
./dns4acme -h
```

See the output of the command above or the [configuration options page](../configuration/index.md) for details on the available command line flags.
